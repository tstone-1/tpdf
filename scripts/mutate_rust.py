"""Breaks a Rust module on purpose, one edit at a time.

The counterpart to `mutate_frontend.py`, and it exists for the same reason: a
test that has only ever passed looks exactly like one that cannot fail. Each
mutation below names the test it is *expected* to turn red, and a mutation that
nothing caught is reported as a defect in the suite rather than shrugged at.

`search.rs` is the module it covers today. It is the densest piece of pure logic
in the backend --- a fold, an index map back through it, and two options that
each change what is accepted --- and every one of its assertions is over a
fixture the module itself never wrote, which is what makes mutation the only
thing that can say whether they bite.

Two properties carried over from the front-end harness, both because
`docs/TRAPS.md` records what their absence costs:

**It cross-checks.** Every run derives the failure count two ways -- by counting
libtest's per-test `FAILED` lines and by reading its summary line -- and a
disagreement is a broken run rather than either answer.

**A run that produced no summary is not a pass.** A compile error from a bad
mutation produces no failing-test lines, which is exactly what a surviving
mutation looks like. It is the likeliest outcome here and the one that would
otherwise read as good news.

Usage:
    scripts/mutate_rust.py            # every mutation
    scripts/mutate_rust.py --list
