/**
 * A functional check of the reading surface, run without a human.
 *
 * Everything else in `src/lib` that runs unattended is a *measurement*. This is
 * not: it asserts that the viewer does what it claims, because the alternative
 * is a class whose behaviour is only ever confirmed by someone looking at a
 * window --- and the repository has already paid twice for a result that was
 * produced by nothing happening (a crash test the optimizer deleted, a scroll
 * benchmark that issued no requests). Both looked like passes.
 *
 * Input is delivered as real `WheelEvent`s and `KeyboardEvent`s dispatched at
 * the viewer's own root, so what is exercised is the handler a trackpad
 * reaches, not a parallel path written for the test.
 *
 * Two checks carry their own control, for the same reason:
 *
 *  - **idling** is asserted in both directions. "Is idle after settling" passes
 *    trivially if the loop never starts, so it is paired with "is not idle
 *    while work is outstanding".
 *  - **coverage after a zoom** is asserted against a *drop* first. Recovering
 *    to 100% proves nothing if the zoom never invalidated anything.
 *
 * Run it with `TPDF_VIEWERCHECK=<file.pdf>`; it prints a table and exits
 * non-zero on the first failure.
